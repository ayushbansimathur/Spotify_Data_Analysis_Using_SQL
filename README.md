## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- Creating Table spotify_data
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS spotify_data(
    Artist VARCHAR(50),
    Track VARCHAR(250),
    Album VARCHAR(250),
	Album_type VARCHAR(50),
    Danceability FLOAT,
    Energy	FLOAT,
    Loudness FLOAT,
    Speechiness	FLOAT,
    Acousticness FLOAT,
    Instrumentalness FLOAT,
    Liveness FLOAT,
    Valence	FLOAT,
    Tempo FLOAT,
    Duration_min FLOAT,	
    Title VARCHAR(250),
    Channel	VARCHAR(100),
    Views BIGINT,
    Likes BIGINT,
    Comments BIGINT,
    Licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    Stream	BIGINT,
    EnergyLiveness FLOAT,
    most_playedon VARCHAR(20)
);
```
## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
SELECT 
    artist,
    track,
    stream 
FROM spotify_data
WHERE stream > 1000000000 
ORDER BY stream DESC
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
SELECT
    artist,
    album
FROM spotify_data
```   
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(comments) AS total_comments
FROM spotify_data
WHERE licensed = TRUE;
```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
```sql
SELECT 
    * 
FROM spotify_data 
WHERE album_type = 'single' 
ORDER BY 1
```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
SELECT 
    artist,
    COUNT(track) OVER(PARTITION BY artist)
FROM spotify_data
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
SELECT 
    album,
    ROUND(AVG(danceability) OVER(PARTITION BY album):: NUMERIC,2) AS avg_danceability
FROM spotify_data
```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        track,
        energy,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY energy DESC) AS rank_per_energy
    FROM spotify_data 
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
WHERE rank_per_energy <= 5
```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT
    track,
    views,
    likes
FROM spotify_data
WHERE official_video IS TRUE
```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
SELECT 
    album,
    track,
    SUM(views) AS all_views_per_album
FROM spotify_data
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 3 DESC;
```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed more on Spotify than on YouTube.
```sql
WITH 
    spotify_played_track AS (
        SELECT
            track AS track_played_on_spotify,
            stream AS spotify_streamed,
            most_playedon
        FROM spotify_data
        WHERE most_playedon ILIKE 'Spotify'
        ),
    YouTube_played_track AS (
        SELECT
            track AS track_played_on_Youtube,
            stream AS YouTube_streamed,
            most_playedon
        FROM spotify_data
        WHERE most_playedon ILIKE 'YouTube'
    )

SELECT
    spt.track_played_on_spotify,
    (CASE WHEN spt.spotify_streamed > ypt.YouTube_streamed THEN 'played more on spotify' 
    ELSE 'played more on YouTube' 
    END) AS winner_platform
FROM spotify_played_track AS spt
JOIN YouTube_played_track AS ypt ON spt.track_played_on_spotify = ypt.track_played_on_Youtube
WHERE
    (CASE 
        WHEN spt.spotify_streamed > ypt.YouTube_streamed THEN 'played more on spotify' 
        ELSE 'played more on YouTube' 
    END) = 'played more on spotify'
```
*** Alternate Solution
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        track,
        SUM(COALESCE((CASE WHEN most_playedon = 'Spotify' THEN stream END),0)) AS streamed_on_spotify,
        SUM(COALESCE((CASE WHEN most_playedon = 'Youtube' THEN stream END),0)) AS streamed_on_YouTube
    FROM spotify_data
    GROUP BY 1
)
WHERE   
    streamed_on_YouTube <> 0 
    AND 
    streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_YouTube
```

### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
5. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
6. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **7 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.17 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:
      ![EXPLAIN Before Index](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_explain_before_index.png)

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.153 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.152 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:
      ![EXPLAIN After Index](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_explain_after_index.png)

- **Graphical Performance Comparison**
    - A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.
    - **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:
      ![Performance Graph](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_graphical%20view%203.png)

      ![Performance Graph](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_graphical%20view%201.png)

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.

2. Set up the database schema and tables using the provided normalization structure.
3. Insert the sample data into the respective tables.
4. Execute SQL queries to solve the listed problems.

## Next Steps
- **Visualize the Data**: Use a data visualization tool like **Tableau** or **Power BI** to create dashboards based on the query results.
- **Expand Dataset**: Add more rows to the dataset for broader analysis and scalability testing.
- **Advanced Querying**: Dive deeper into query optimization and explore the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.
